===========

FPGA Port Scanner BTC Mining Utility by infamousDutch   This software is for miners mining on Windows that would like to use CGMiner or BFGMiner and enable it to scan for idle FPGA devices.  Scans for idle FPGAs (currently only Bitforce) every 2 minutes and fires up a miner to start mining. Currently supports cgminer and bfgminers. Takes one parameter, the miner and mining parameters you wish to start up when a port is found to be open.
